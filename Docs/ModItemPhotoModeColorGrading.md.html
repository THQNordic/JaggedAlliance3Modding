Project setup

## Project setup

 - Open *File -> Project Manager* or press *Shift + 1*.
 - Click on *Import* and select "ColorGrade.drp"
 - Open the "ColorGrade" scene you just imported.
 - In the *Media Pool* tab there should be screenshots which have errors.
 - Select all of the screenshots, right-click them and press *Relink Selected Clips*.
 - Navigate to "ModTools/ColorGrading/Screenshots/" and press *Select Folder*  

 If there are problems finding *ToneMapping.cube* complete the following steps:

  - Open *File -> Project Settings*.
  - Go to the *Color Management* tab.
  - In the *Lookup Tables* subcategory press the *Update Lists* button.
  - Press *Save*.

Exporting and adding it to your mod
================================

 - You can take RAW screenshots in EXR format from the LightModel editor.
 - Use *ToneMapping.cube* as a final node in your grade. Its purpose is to match DaVinci Resolve's results to in-game ones.
 - After you have your desired grading, in the *Nodes* tab disable the tone-mapping node by selecting it and pressing *Ctrl + D* or unlink it by directly connecting the previous node to the end one (marked with a green dot). 
 - Right-click on the clip containing your grade and select *Generate LUT -> 65 Point Cube*. 
 - Save it in your mod's directory. 
 - Go to the mod editor and add *New -> Other... -> Photo mode - Grading LUT*
 - Fill out the path to your *.cube* file, id, and display name and save the mod.
 - Test it by going to the photo mode and pressing on *Color grading*. You should be seeing your newly added grading LUT's name.
