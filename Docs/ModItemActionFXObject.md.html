ActionFXObject
==============
This mod item creates and places an object when an FX action is triggered. Inherits [ActionFX](ActionFX.md.html). Read [ActionFX](ActionFX.md.html) first for the common properties. 

Properties
----------

Colorization Palette (`self.ColorizationPalette`)
:  Can be applied if the decal is exported with a colorization map. The colors in 1,2 and 3 correspond to an RGB colorization map. If there is no colorization map exported, the Color modifier property should be applied instead.

1-3: Base Color (`self.EditableColor1`)
:  Base color controls the surface tint.

1-3: Roughness (`self.EditableRoughness1`)
:  Roughness controls how shiny the surface geometry is.

1-3: Metallic (`self.EditableMetallic1`)
:  Metallic controls the degree of metallic luster a surface has.

AnimationLoops (`self.AnimationLoops`)
: Additional time.

Object1 (`self.Object`) - Object4 (`self.Object4`)
:  The id of the decal preset which will be applied. One of the entities is picked at random when the FX is triggered.

Animation (`self.Animation`)
: Allowed values are: idle.

FadeIn (`self.FadeIn`)
: Fade in time in milliseconds. Included in the overall time.

FadeOut (`self.FadeOut`)
: Fade out time in milliseconds. Included in the overall time.

Flags (`self.Flags`)
: Allowed values are: OnGround, LockedOrientation, Mirrored, OnGroundTiltByGround, SyncWithParent.

Scale (`self.Scale`)
:  Decal scale in %. 

ScaleMember (`self.ScaleMember`)
:  Object member which will be used for the scale. This can also be a method which will be called and the result will override the Scale property.

Opacity (`self.Opacity`)
:  Decal opacity.

ColorModifier (`self.ColorModifier`)
:  Additional color modifier.

UseActorColorization (`self.UseActorColorization`)
:  Toggle on/off.

AlwaysVisible (`self.AlwaysVisible`)
:  Toggle on/off. When enabled will bypass the engine optimization for drawing off-screen and far away objects at a performance cost. 

Source (`self.Source`)
: Allowed values are: Actor, ActorParent, ActorOwner, Target, ActionPos.

Spot (`self.Spot`)
: Allowed values are: Origin, Muzzle, Muzzlea, Muzzleb, Stepl, Stepr.

Attach (`self.Attach`)
: Set true if the object should move with the source.

Offset (`self.Offset`)
:  Offset from the target spot.

OffsetDir (`self.OffsetDir`)
:  Offset direction. Allowed values are "", "SourceAxisX", "SourceAxisX2D", "SourceAxisY", "SourceAxisZ", "ActionDir", "ActionDir2D", "FaceTarget", "FaceTarget2D", "FaceActor", "FaceActor2D", "FaceActionPos", "FaceActionPos2D", "Random2D", "SpotX", "SpotY", "SpotZ", "RotateByPresetAngle".

Orientation (`self.Orientation`)
:  Decal orientation. Has the same allowed values as OffsetDir.

OrientationAxis (`self.OrientationAxis`)
:  Axis used for orientation of the decal.

Pick frame by (`self.anim_type`)
: This parameter determines the UV scrolling animation parameters that are used when the object is exported with a sprite sheet texture in the materials. The animation consists of a set number of frames, defined by the parameters inside Haemimont Material when exporting from Blender - the Animation Frames X and Animation Frames Y parameters, and has an animation time specified in milliseconds.

Speed Multiplier (`self.anim_speed`)
: This parameter multiplies the animation time, effectively adjusting the animation speed.

Sequence time (`self.sequence_time_remap`)
: This parameter allows you to change the pacing of the animation from linear to non-linear. It affects the speed of the animation at different points in time, creating a more dynamic and interesting visual effect.
