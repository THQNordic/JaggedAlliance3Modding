Appearance Preset
====

This mod item allows to change the appearance of the exisiting units in the game and create new appearances for custom units. You can choose different parts of clothing for the unit from the dropdowns and change the colorization for some of the exisiting assets. Please note that the assets that are part of the mercenaries' appearance cannot be colorized.  

Please note that you will be resticted from attaching assets using both female and male animations in the same appearance preset. This will result in errors. 

You can import custom clothing assets following the instructions in the [Entity](ModItemEntity.md.html) mod item and the New Imp Merc sample mod.
The most important aspest is to set up the appropriate class of the entity so that it can be recognized by the game and appear in the dropdown for the dedicated part.
