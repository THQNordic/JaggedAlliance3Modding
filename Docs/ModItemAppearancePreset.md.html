Appearance Preset
====

This mod item allows to change the appearance of existing units in the game and create new appearances for custom units. You can choose different parts of clothing for the unit from the dropdown menus and change the colorization for some of the existing assets. However, assets that are part of the mercenaries' appearance cannot be colorized.  

Please note that you will be restricted from attaching assets using both female and male animations in the same appearance preset. Doing so will result in errors. 

You can import custom clothing assets following the instructions in the [Entity](ModItemEntity.md.html) mod item and the New Imp Merc sample mod.
The most important aspect is to set up the appropriate class of the entity so that it can be recognized by the game and appear in the dropdown for the dedicated part.
