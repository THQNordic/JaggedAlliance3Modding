[Keyword: Greeting]
	BiffNPC: We did it! We're still alive! God, that was scary!... I mean, the situation was complicated. Good thing I was around to provide tactical advice.
		Gus: Like screaming for help and trying to hide?
		Wolf: I don't know what we would have done without you. Sincerely. I mean that. The possibilities are endless.
		Larry: Biff, man, you're MOTIVATING. I mean, when you're whimpering and running around, even I feel like a badass merc compared to you.
		Scope: You're the best distraction for the enemy a sniper could wish for, love. 
	BiffNPC: ...Anyway. I'm done with this hellhole. Time for me to bail out!
[Keyword: Where are you going?]
	BiffNPC: Home! Anywhere but here! Good luck dealing with <em>Santiago</em>. You'll need it. As for me, I just want to put this whole mess in my rear view mirror.
[Keyword: Can you help us expose Corazon?]
	BiffNPC: I don't know... If she ever gets brought to justice, I guess I can <em>testify about her shenanigans</em> with the Major, assuming neither of them would be able to, um... do anything to me.
		Blood: I give you some advice: see a doctor. I think you may be missing some back bone.
		Raider: I suppose that's better than nothing... but not by much.
[Keyword: What about the diamond?]
	BiffNPC: I will keep it as payment for my trouble here. Even if I sell it for a fraction of its real price, I'd probably still get enough to revive M.E.R.C.!
		Larry_Clean: You got it back there in <em>Diamond Red</em>. You ran away with it and just left me there, man.
		BiffNPC: You were surrounded! There was no way to save you...
		Larry_Clean: Well, these guys here - they saved me and took care of me. And I have as much claim on the goddamn diamond as you do.
		Smiley: Se√±or Apscott... Biff. We have fought and bled together. This diamond belongs to all of us. You told me at the start that we were all in this together. Was it not so?
	BiffNPC: Okay, okay! It's precious, but it only brought me bad luck. Alright, I'll leave it with you guys.
[Keyword: What about the diamond?]
	BiffNPC: It brought me some really bad luck, but... I've decided to keep it for myself as payment for this horrible mission.
		Larry: Aren't you going to throw it into a volcano?
		BiffNPC: Uh, what? No!
		Larry: I was there, man, three months ago. Destroy it!
		BiffNPC: No!
		Larry: It's fate is, like, bound to the fate of Grand Chien!
		BiffNPC: God damn it, Larry, you're out of your mind.
[Keyword: What about the diamond?]
	BiffNPC: It brought me some really bad luck, but... I've decided to keep it for myself as payment for this horrible mission.
		Vicki: It be a bit too big for a wedding ring, mon.
		Hitman: Carrying around a rock that big is like having a bullseye painted on your back.
		Livewire: I completely agree with your decision. If you ever need a safe place to store it, just ask me and I will tell you exactly where you can leave it.
	BiffNPC: I think I can sell it. Even for a fraction of its real price, I'd probably still get enough to revive M.E.R.C.!
		Buns: What is dead should stay dead.
		Len: Sometimes dead is better.
		Meltdown: Ain't you learned nothing, Apscott? You'd do better just shoving that diamond where no one can see it shine!
		Kalyna: Then you should check to see if M.E.R.C. actually wants to be revived first. Otherwise, the diamond is wasted.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	BiffNPC: Alright, time for me to leave.
		Larry_Clean: What about that diamond of yours?
		Smiley: What about this diamond of yours?
	BiffNPC: Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there. No, wait... it's right here in my pocket. Isn't that odd, now? And yet, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?
		Smiley: I think you should leave the diamond behind, Biff.
		Larry_Clean: I think you should leave the diamond behind, Biff.
	BiffNPC: Oh, yes... of course. You're right, the diamond belongs to this place... To you. Well, time for me to hit the road. Goodbye, friends.
		Larry_Clean: Until our next meeting.
		Smiley: Until our next meeting.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	BiffNPC: Well, thanks for the extraction. I'll send you a post card from some place with no weirdos trying to kill me all the time. And if you ever need combat support here in Grand Chien...
		Len: Yes?
		Gus: Yeah?
		Meltdown: No.
	BiffNPC: ...Or if you need someone with fighting experience against the Legion...
		Len: ...Yes?
		Gus: ...Well?
		Meltdown: Nope.
	BiffNPC: ...Then please don't hesitate and make sure to call someone else. Goodbye!
