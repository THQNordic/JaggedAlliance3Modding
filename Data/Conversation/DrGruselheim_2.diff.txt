[Keyword: Greeting]
	DrGruselheim: I can officially capitulate. Take me to your government as an honored prisoner!
[Keyword: Greeting]
	DrGruselheim: So, what are you going to do with me?
[Keyword: Who are you?]
	DrGruselheim: My name is Dr. Rudolph <em>Gruselheim</em>. I have personally designed this complex, and sadly, I am both its director and, um, prisoner.
[Keyword: What is the role of Siegfried in all this?]
	DrGruselheim: Die Gestapo appointed Siegfried as my, hmm, assistant. He was supposed to contribute as administrative director for the completion of <em>Projekt Eisdrache</em>.
[Keyword: Tell us about your research]
	DrGruselheim: Ach, natürlich! What are you interested in?
	[Keyword: Weapons Lab]
		DrGruselheim: Ach, that brings me back... fifteen years. <em>Siegfried</em> devitrified me for the first time with his silly request for making "indestructible armor".
		DrGruselheim: Of course, nothing is indestructible, but one must admit that <em>Kompositum 58</em> comes very close when applied to various polymers.
	[Keyword: Bio Lab]
		DrGruselheim: Seven years ago, Siegfried ordered me to create "the perfect virus" that could be delivered behind enemy lines and cause chaos and mayhem.
		DrGruselheim: I started with the common Rabies genome and developed its much more aggressive <em>Red Rabies</em> variant... And I only agreed because he promised he won't use the virus unless the very existence of my fatherland was threatened.
		DrGruselheim: You can imagine my annoyance when I learned <em>Siegfried</em> tried to sell it to North Korea! For better or worse, the plane crashed in the jungle above us.
	[Keyword: Cryo Lab]
		DrGruselheim: It was before the war when I discovered the <em>Wunderfrostschutzmittel</em>, as I call it, in the Drachenberg mountains north from here.
		DrGruselheim: The <em>WFSM</em> is a wonderful cryo-protective regenerative agent. It makes the <em>vitrification</em> procedure possible with negligible intra-cell ice formation.
		DrGruselheim: Die Wehrmacht was very interested in the possibilities that they built the whole U-Bahn from the coast to the mountains. And <em>Projekt Eisdrache</em> was born.
	[Keyword: Diesel Clinic]
		DrGruselheim: Hmm, Diesel. Some ten or twelve years ago, the original troops who guarded us were starting to get old, and Siegfried himself wasn't the boy I remembered anymore. 
		DrGruselheim: So, he devitrified me and asked me to create a "serum" that can make the old young again. Ha! That is not possible! Not within the time frame we had! 
		DrGruselheim: I developed the <em>Super Soldat</em> program instead. <em>Siegfried</em> was happy with it and ever since has been using it to turning local boys into relentless war machines.
	[Keyword: What happened at the Drop?]
		DrGruselheim: The last time he put me out of the glass, Siegfried ordered me to enhance the Diesel formula.
		DrGruselheim: When the Legion appeared they attacked <em>The Drop</em>. Gott bless their savage little minds! They used explosives so extensively they severed the railway to <em>Landsbach</em>.
		DrGruselheim: I had a good laugh when I heard <em>Siegfried</em> lost a whole shipment of <em>Altered Diesel</em> while trying to send it by truck to his troops here.
[Keyword: Who are these people in the cryo chambers?]
	DrGruselheim: These are the people <em>vitrified</em> as part of <em>Projekt Eisdrache</em>.
[Keyword: Who are these people in the cryo chambers?]
	DrGruselheim: When they realized they were losing the war, some of the top <em>Wehrmacht</em> und <em>Gestapo officers</em> were vitrified here, biding their time until Siegfried prepares their "grand return".
	DrGruselheim: What do you want me do with them?
	[Keyword: Seal them here forever]
		DrGruselheim: "Forever" is such a demanding word, but this complex was built to last. So, I will let them sleep until the temperature control fails or water finally makes its way into the bunker. 
		DrGruselheim: It won't be a great loss to humanity either way.
	[Keyword: Cut their bio support]
		DrGruselheim: Technically, the is no bio support - only temperature control. You see, they are effectively turned to glass. But if I take this hammer here...
	[Keyword: Send them to court]
		DrGruselheim: Devitrification is not a simple process. It will take time, but once it is done, I will be happy if they face justice for their crimes.
[Keyword: Time to decide what to do with you]
	DrGruselheim: I am looking forward to it!
	[Keyword: You are free to leave]
		DrGruselheim: Really? Danke! I hope I will be able to fit in this world of the seventies. Or was it the eighties?
Never mind! I am ready!
	[Keyword: You will go to jail as Nazi collaborator]
		DrGruselheim: Yes, that was what I have been asking for... Wait, you mean actual prison?...
		DrGruselheim: Well, it is what it is. It can't be worse than spending my life underground and being frozen to glass every ten years.
	[Keyword: You will work for us in the Weapons Lab]
		DrGruselheim: Ach. Schade. I was hoping I will see the sun once again.
Well, at least I'm not working for the Nazi anymore, right? Right?...
	[Keyword: You will run the Sanatorium and find a cure for Red Rabies]
		DrGruselheim: Ach, natürlich. It's hard to contain a bio weapon once it has been released, but I guess I am the most qualified person for this task.
		DrGruselheim: Don't you want me to improve the formula instead? Nein? Never mind, I'll create a robust inoculation agent for you.
	[Keyword: You will run the Diesel Clinic and help people]
		DrGruselheim: That sounds interesting! I have some new ideas how to improve the Super Soldat formula by introducing females to the program. 
		DrGruselheim: No? Fine, fine... I will concentrate on fixing young Siegfried's mistakes.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	DrGruselheim: I will remain right here.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	DrGruselheim: Take your time.
