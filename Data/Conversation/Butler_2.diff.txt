[Keyword: Greeting]
	Butler: It is over. They are gone. All of them!
		Blood: And we didn't even have to dress up like ghosts to do it.
	Butler: Your methods are definitely more effective than mine.
		Buns: Don't feel bad. We are professionals.
		Raider: That's because we train hard and fight like a team!
		Thor: If you're interested, I can give you a ten point plan to unlock your maximum potential.
	Butler: Maybe with people like you around, those bandits won't bother with an old man in a haunted house... And I can turn it into a home again. Here, I won't be needing these anymore.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Butler: Welcome to <em>Butler's Haunt</em>. You like it? It seems a fitting name for the place these days.
[Keyword: What will you do now?]
	Butler: I will try to fix this place up. I still hope the master of the house, <em>Mr. Ditch</em>, will return one day. It is silly, I know, but it would be nice to see him again.
		Kalyna: That isn't silly at all! I believe hope is the most powerful magic in the world.
		Thor: Not silly at all, my friend! The power of hope is crucial in focusing your mind and manifesting a better tomorrow.
		MD: I'm sure you'll see him again! I mean, probably.
[Keyword: What about the treasure they mentioned?]
	Butler: It is not mine to give!...
		Larry: Man, I knew it! There IS a treasure!
		Nails: Well, then it ain't yours to keep, either. Got it?
		Kalyna: There's treasure?! How exciting! Is it guarded by a gnome with a bunch of riddles?
	Butler: ...That is, there is some <em>money</em> hidden in the mansion. But it belongs to <em>Mr. Ditch</em> and as long as there is a chance he is still alive, I would rather die than betray his trust.
		Blood: Oh come on. If the scuzzball doesn't give a shit about his bloody colonizer money, then why should you care?
		Nails: That can be arranged.
		Barry: Such loyalty is admirable.
	Butler: Since he didn't come to take back his money, I fear he may be in trouble. Please help me find him! I'm sure he will reward you, he is a generous man.
[Keyword: What about the treasure?]
	Butler: I guess you should ask <em>Mr. Ditch</em> about it. I have kept his money safe for so long - now that I know he's alive, I can't just give it away without his permission.
[Keyword: Tell us about Mr. Ditch]
	Butler: He was a director in some big <em>foreign corporation</em>. I think they had some interest in mining, but that's all I know. He never talked of his job. I think he hated it.
		Raven: A corporation with some interest in mining? I wonder...
		Buns: Something about all that sounds very familiar.
		DrQ: Ten years ago? Hmmm...
	Butler: He was away from home when the civil war broke out... Maybe for the best. They would have tortured and killed him for his money, as they did with the servants.
		Blood: It's all clear - when the shit hit the fan, your man just ran away and left you guys to deal with it.
		Reaper: Sounds like Death was very busy that day.
		Sidney: Dreadful tragedy. Dreadful.
	Butler: It has been ten years since. He may be dead, but I wish I could find him, or at least learn where he is buried.

	Butler: Oh, thanks. I'll put this to work kindling the fire in the stove. Got any more? 
[Keyword: Mr. Ditch is dead]
	Butler: Is he? You... you are sure?
		Magic: That's our job, man. We have a list - just like Santa. Your Mr. Ditch was one of the nice boys, but we were there a bit too late to help him.
		Butler: You... you saw him die? Did he say something about the mansion? Or... about me?
		Magic: Oh, yeah. He said: "I wonder if Mister Luthando is still kickin' it? That dude was like my brother! I miss him!" And then he, like... He died.
		Butler: He remembered me! Poor Mr. Ditch!
		Livewire: Ooo... Yes. Certain. Absolutely. You know, I saw those thugs kill him before they came here.
		Butler: They killed him?!
		Livewire: You've got to believe me, especially considering that they are permanently incapable of arguing against the truth of what I am saying.
		Butler: I trust you - after all, you saved me.
		Fox: I'm sorry. Ummm, yes, he's definitely dead. Stiff as a board. Those cutthroats got him earlier. Actually, that's why we came here - to avenge him.
		Butler: Oh... Thank you!
	Butler: I guess I don't need to guard this treasure anymore. You helped me and you were with Mr. Ditch on his deathbed. I suppose he would like you to have the <em>money</em>.
[Keyword: Mr. Ditch is alive!]
	Butler: Is he? That is the best news I have heard in ten years! Please, tell me his address. I will go see him at once!
		Buns: Not much of an address - he is living in solitude as a hermit.
		Mouse: Okay... Better write this down. He is at One Mushroom Place on One Jungle Way.
		Wolf: Better pack a lunch. Got hiking boots?
[Keyword: Mr. Ditch is alive... We lied to you]
	Butler: But... You told me... Oh, I understand, it was all about the money, wasn't it? I hope he won't be angry at me for losing his fortune.
		Raider: I don't think he cares about money anymore.
		Ice: Trust me, brother man, your friend ain't got no need for cheddar.
		Grizzly: He spends his days tripping balls in the jungle. I don't think he's worried about cash.
	Butler: Anyway, I'm glad he is alive. This is the best news I've heard in ten years.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	Butler: Goodbye. Don't let the past haunt you.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	Butler: I'm going to see Mr. Ditch. I hope he will accept me back as a servant or... just as a friend. Farewell, mercenaires.
