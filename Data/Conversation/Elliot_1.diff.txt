	Spike: I let you keep that rank you bought off a Grand Chien officer because I thought it was funny. Come to find out you been using it to impersonate me. Now I don't think it's funny anymore.
	Elliot: B-but I didn't mean to do it! I just never corrected people who got the wrong idea... Oh, god, why did you bring THEM here with you?! No-no-no, not again!

[Keyword: You are Elliot from Arulco]
		Spike: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a dear old friend, the runner up in every competition with two participants, the one and only - "Major" <em>Elliot</em> from <em>Arulco</em>!
		Buns: I have a perfect memory of faces and yours is one I recall being very close to Deidranna.
		Smiley: Come on, stop playing games. We both know who you are.
		Len: You're that little guy with all the head wounds in the Meduna Palace, right?
		Gus: Guess you didn't fly away far enough, Woodfinch. I recognize you.
		Grunty: You were the one to whom Deidranna administered many beatings. Your face looks much better.
	Elliot: Alright, I confess. I am <em>Elliot</em>. I just... I had to go somewhere after you mercenaries killed Deidranna and ruined <em>Arulco</em>.
		Len: We didn't ruin it, we liberated it.
		Elliot: Po-TAY-to, Po-TAH-to...
		Smiley: The glorious and noble mercenaries saved it! It was Deidranna who was ruining it.
		Elliot: She was just misunderstood.
		Grunty: I seem to recall her using tanks to flatten whole villages. What was that?
		Elliot: That was just... land re-development.
	Elliot: Grand Chien isn't a bad place if you have some connections... As a <em>Major</em>, I have the chance to get the <em>respect</em> I deserve! I mean, I'm still waiting for the respect, but... But now you mercs have to come along and ruin everything... again!
[Keyword: So you are from Arulco]
		Fox: Did big bad mercenaries blow up your country and give you a boo-boo? Awww. Want me to kiss it and make it better?
		Livewire: Why are you so mad about what happened in Arulco? Did you have a lot invested in Deidranna's plans?
		Magic: That Arulco business got you all worked up. Did you have some kind of gig with the old lady's regime?
	Elliot: Yes, but... No! I just know about Arulco because I watched the news on TV. I was horrified to see how viciously you defeated Her Highness <em>Deidranna</em> and her noble advisor <em>Elliot</em>.
		Grizzly: Her noble advisor... who?
		Elliot: Elliot!
		Scope: I don't remember any advisor. I do remember a little rat-faced man she used to kick around... What was his name?
		Elliot: Elliot! And I... HE doesn't have a rat face, he just has very sharp facial features.
		Ice: Never heard of no Elliot. Oh, wait. Was he the dude in the Palace with all them bitch-slap bruises on his face?
		Elliot: Those were... just a misunderstanding.
[Keyword: Your soldiers donâ€™t respect you?]
	Elliot: No, not really... But at least they fear me! And that's the same as respect, isn't it?
		Igor: Nyet. If I respect someone, I protect them. If I fear someone, I kill them.
		Len: Having a soldier's respect means they'll die for you. Making them fear you means one day you'll get out of bed and step on a land mine.
		Kalyna: You are an idiot.
	Elliot: They know I can always throw them to the crocs! Just like I did with... oh, poor <em>Stony</em>.
[Keyword: What happened to Stony?]
	Elliot: During the opening ceremony of this <em>Croc Plank</em> I wanted to show them what happens if they don't listen to me... It wasn't my fault... I told him, "STONY, YOU IDIOT! Don't stand so close to the edge!"
		Mouse: I think I know what's coming. Covering my ears.
		Larry_Clean: Not sure I want to hear the rest.
		Larry: Hey man, the edge is where LIFE is!
	Elliot: I was just going to push him a little, just to make a show, but when I did, he... he slipped and... the crocs ate him. He was my only friend...
		Blood: Man, you are an idiot.
		Flay: Wonderful! I am sad that I missed it.
		Sidney: Apologies if this has been mentioned before, but... you truly are an idiot.
	Elliot: I know. I'm an idiot. I told everyone I did it on purpose, because... he was plotting against me. I feel awful, but what could I do? My soldiers would never respect me if they knew the truth!
[Keyword: Elliot, you idiot!]
		Spike: Elliot, you idiot!
		Nails: I've known some idiots in my time, Elliot, but you take the cake.
		Shadow: Elliot, has anyone ever told you you're an idiot?
	Elliot: I know, I know! I'm an idiot, Your Highn... I mean, um, yes.
[Keyword: Who do you think WE are?]
	Elliot: You are those darn mercenaries who devastated Arulco!
		Fidel: It makes Fidel very happy to know his work is appreciated!
		Raven: Well, we can't take all the credit. Deidranna's tanks did most of the work.
		Barry: This is not true! I only exploded what needed to be exploded.
	Elliot: A-and are devastating Grand Chien, too, of course! That's more important to me, because I'm not from <em>Arulco</em> or anything. Nope. I am a <em>Major</em> of the Grand Chien army... and you'll show me some respect - even if my own soldiers don't.
[Keyword: Are you THE Major?]
	Elliot: Yes, I am! Just ask anyone... except maybe my soldiers.
		Tex: No, you not look right for part. Not tall enough. Get yourself platform soles.
		MD: Gosh, I expected the Major to be a lot bigger... and less fidgety.
		Omryn: This major is too small. I say we throw him back. Wait for bigger one.

		Hitman: You may be a major weenie, but... you're not THE Major.
		Fauda: If you are the Major, Shaitan must be having trouble finding good help.
		PierreMerc: He is not Le Major. I do not even think he is "a" major.
		Raider: I reviewed my notes. Your story doesn't add up. I don't believe you're the Major.
		Scully: If you're the Major, I'm a monkey's uncle. Actually... I might be a monkey's uncle, but that still doesn't make you the Major.
		Thor: I do not think you are the Major. I would imagine his aura to be very dark. Yours is the color of... urine.
	Elliot: True... But the real Major is far away from here, up there in <em>Eagle's Nest</em> in the <em>Highlands</em>. So what if people think I am the big, scary Major? It's not hurting anyone.
		Wolf: I don't think you really thought that one through, chief.
		DrQ: Wisdom is a gift that is given to precious few people. I hope you one day receive it.
		Vicki: You know there be people trying to kill the Major, right mon?
