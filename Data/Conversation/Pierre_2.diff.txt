	Spike: How are you doing, kid? You enjoying your stay in the camp?
	Pierre: Major! You... Les mercenaires worked for you all along?!
	Spike: Nah. We came to an agreement. Let's just say we're helping each other tie up a few loose ends. 
	Pierre: I... I don't understand. Have you come here to mock me?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Pierre: What are you doing here? You came to mock me for being wrong about the <em>Legion</em>? Mock me if you will, but you are no better than them.

	Pierre: What are you doing here? You came to mock me for being wrong about the <em>Legion</em>?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Pierre: You, here? I have heard about your deeds, but I didn't expect you to come to this god-forsaken place. I... I feel compelled to admit that you were right and I was wrong about the <em>Legion</em>.

	[Keyword: Actually not]
		Spike: Do you remember what I taught you about honor, valor and nobility?...
		Pierre: Yes, I remember all too well.
			Raider: Careful what you're about to say, Spike.
			Buns: Major Scallion, now is not the time for one of your "jokes".
			Sidney: Major Scallion, if I may, I would ensure your next words are of a conciliatory nature.
		Spike: Well... I was full of shit. I was using you and all the other Legion boys just to get what I wanted. Most of the Legionnaires were just thieves and murderers, so I don't feel too bad about it. But you... Well, you were different. You deserved better than that.
		Pierre: Then why did you send me to the mines? Why did you send me here?
		Spike: Because I couldn't bring myself to kill you, but I had to punish you to make an example for the others. And I knew you were strong enough to take it. Simple as that. Look, I don't expect you to forgive me, but... I am sorry.
		Pierre: I do not know if I believe you, but I... will think about what you said.
	[Keyword: Actually not]
	[Keyword: They just used you]
		Pierre: Yes, and now you want to use me as well. I would rather rot here in this hell hole than serve someone else's "great purpose". Leave me be.
			Red: Have it your way, ya thick-headed ninny!
			Mouse: Go ahead and rot then. See if I care.
			Wolf: I don't know about any "great purpose" but you're sure missing out on a lot of fun!
	[Keyword: They just used you]
		Pierre: Yes, they did. How could I not see through all those hollow words and promises for a great future? I was so easy to fool.
			Livewire: Yes, it is true. You are very naive. But you are not completely without hope.
			Fox: Don't feel bad. You're young and cute, so it's easy for people to take advantage of you. I have some experience in that area.
			Magic: Hey, don't sweat it. Everybody falls for an illusion every now and again, ya' dig?
	[Keyword: Karma is a bitch!]
			Spike: Do you remember what I taught you about honor, valor and nobility?
			Pierre: Yes, I remember all too well.
			Spike: And everything I said about your sacred patriotic duty to your country?
			Pierre: Yes?
			Spike: And about the virtues of the Legion?
			Pierre: Yes, I do!
			Spike: Well, it was complete and utter bullshit, kid.
			Pierre: ...
		Pierre: You want me to admit I was a fool? Okay, I was. Gloat all you want.
			Meltdown: Dumbass.
			DrQ: Fate is a wheel trapped in a waterfall, but a person can choose to be the water or the wheel.

	Pierre: What do you want from me?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Pierre: Yes?
[Keyword: What happened to you?]
	Pierre: YOU happened to me. Le Major does not tolerate failure, and I accepted my punishment. I deserved it... 
		Gus: No, you didn't, Woodman. A good commander doesn't throw his soldiers in prison for losing a battle. That's what the commies do. 
		Len: I don't think so. Only dictators throw their soldiers in prison for losing a battle.
		Meltdown: You're welcome, dumbass.
		Ice: You're welcome, dude. Anytime.
	Pierre: But in <em>Diamond Red</em> I saw... I saw how they treat our people in the name of the <em>Legion</em>. I learned of all the slavery and the abuse, I heard the stories and I saw what kind of people Le Major favors. People like <em>Slave Master Graaf</em>.
[Keyword: What happened to you?]
	Pierre: YOU happened to me. And you, <em>Major</em>, punished me for failing to defeat those that you have now joined. Isn't that ironic? I accepted my punishment, but what about you?
	Spike: Don't worry about me, kid. When the time comes, I'll take my punishment and I doubt I'll get off as easy as just being sent to <em>Diamond Red</em>.
	Pierre: In Diamond Red I saw... I saw how you treated our people in the name of the <em>Legion</em>. I learned of all the slavery and the abuse, I heard the stories and I saw what kind of people you favor. People like <em>Slave Master Graaf</em>.
	Spike: He served his purpose. I couldn't afford to have you escape and come try to kill me. You were the only one in the whole Legion I think could've actually done it.
	Pierre: I... How do you do that? Your words fill me with anger and pride at the same time.
	Spike: What can I say? I got a gift.
		Len: I'd say it's more like a curse, old buddy.
		Gus: Yeah, you got a gift. A real gift for getting into trouble.
		Grunty: It's called demagoguery and it is a gift no one wants.
		Shadow: It's called manipulation. It's like a form of camouflage, but for words.
[Keyword: So the Legion isn't what you expected?]
	Pierre: We needed a cause to unite us, a promise that we can serve our country and work for a better future... At least some of us did. Others just needed an excuse.
		Spike: You nailed it! I always knew you were smart, kid.
		Len: It's always like that. War attracts those types of people like shit attracts flies.
		Fauda: Where there is war, there are always profiteers.
		DrQ: It is much easier to add evil to evil than it is to add good.
	Pierre: At the end of the day, the <em>Legion</em> turned out to be just a cover for greed and violence, and for the madness of <em>Le Major</em>.
		Spike: I am not mad. I am differently sane.
[Keyword: We killed Graaf]
	Pierre: Yes, I heard that and I'm glad you did. For some people, it is a real shame they can be killed only once. 
		Meltdown: You got that right!
		Fidel: Some people? Why only only some people?
		Ivan: Да. Fascist needs to die.
		Spike: Don't look at me! I've been killed at least three times, judging from the rumors I've heard.
	Pierre: My only regret is I couldn't kill him myself. I tried. Yes, it's true... and I almost succeeded. That's why they moved me here.
		Spike: Bullshit. I sent you here, because if you tried again and succeeded, the boys would have expected me to execute you. To tell the truth, I was kinda hoping you'd break out of here and come try to kill me instead.
		Pierre: Why would you want that?
		Spike: I wasn't planning on letting you succeed! It was my getaway plan. You and I could fake my death, you could take over the Legion and do what you want with it, and I could disappear. But these A.I.M. yahoos got to me first, so there went that idea.
[Keyword: We hired Graaf to keep him in check]
		Livewire: Oh, we found an original solution for the problem with that asshole Graaf. We hired him! That way, we can always keep an eye on him. Brilliant, right?
		Fox: We didn't trust that Graaf either! That's why we hired him, so that we could control him. We couldn't let him keep being naughty, could we?
		Magic: Graaf's working for us now. We cut a deal. He plays it straight, he gets to live.
		Spike: Yeah. Just like me. They're collectors of lost souls, our friends here. When do you join in?
		Pierre: Don't even think about it.
	Pierre: You could have just killed Graaf!
		Fox: And become just like him? No thanks.
		Livewire: True, but then we would have had to hire someone else and there would have been this big long interview process and... ugh! Who needs that?
		Magic: Still might. Guess we'll see if he can keep his nose clean.
	Pierre: Anyway, I hope you will make him atone for his sins.
[Keyword: We killed the Major]
	Pierre: This is for the best. You should have met him before... He was an inspiring leader and a good man.
		Gus: Some of us have, Woody. You're right, he was one of the good ones.
		Len: I had the honor of knowing him... before. He was a good soldier, and a good friend.
	Pierre: But it seems like he had been rotting from the inside, and that rot slowly turned him into a madman. Yes, I think even he knew at some point he had to be stopped.
[Keyword: You can help us make things right]
	Pierre: Really?...
		Spike: You and me, like the good old days - what could go wrong?
		Pierre: You let them hang <em>my father</em> and now you will make that right, will you?
		Pierre: You hired <em>Le Major</em> here, the monster who filled my head with lies...
		Pierre: You hired that bloodsucker <em>Graaf</em> and let him abuse your workers just to squeeze more tiny diamonds out of them...
		Pierre: ...You have taken the riches of my country and handed them over to those <em>greedy foreigners</em>...
	Pierre: ...And you want me to believe that somehow you will make things right? No, I don't trust you. I would rather rot to death in this hell hole than help you.
		Red: Oh, look who's a fine judge of character all of a sudden. Well, to hell with ya!
		Tex: Frontier justice is harsh mistress, kemosabe.
		Shadow: Well, we never claimed to be perfect.
[Keyword: You can help us make things right]
		Buns: It's not too late to help fix the damage the Legion has done.
		Sidney: Not to sound unreasonably optimistic, but I believe there is still a chance to undo the damage the Legion has done.
		Raider: There's still a chance to restore law and order to this country.
	Pierre: It sounds weird, but... From what I have been hearing about you, I feel I can trust you.
		Pierre: Even though you spared this madman here...
		Spike: They gave me a second chance. Look at me, full of remorse, but reformed, all in white like an angel!
		Pierre: Shut up. I'm talking to les mercenaires. As I said, despite not killing him, you did some good.
		Pierre: You ended the bloody reign of <em>Le Major</em>...
		Pierre: You killed that slaver and murderer <em>Graaf</em>...
		Pierre: You made sure that snitch <em>Herman</em> was punished...
		Pierre: You have taken care of my dad's friends in <em>Ernie</em>...
		Pierre: You achieved something unheard of when you forced that snake <em>Bastien</em> to help people instead of abusing them...
	Pierre: ...And above all, you seem to genuinely care about our country. So... what do you want me to do for you?
	[Keyword: Join us]
		Pierre: And you want to... take me with you? Let me become one of you? This is a great honor and I hope I won't disappoint you, mercenaires.
			Spike: I don't know about great honor... But I promise you we'll have a lot of fun.
			Nails: I got my eye on you, punk.
			Len: Guess we'll see. Fall in.
			Raider: As long as you're sincere about being reformed, I'm sure you won't.
			Gus: Yeah, we'll see. Now let's get you some gear, Woodstock.
			Scope: Brilliant! I'm sure you'll do fine. Just maybe check with us first before killing any civilians, right?
			Fauda: Fight well and with honor and you will fit right in.
			Grunty: I am sure you won't. I only have one rule: Stay away from my foot powder.
			Shadow: I'll be watching you. You won't see me, but I'll see you.
		Pierre: And I have just one thing to ask - please, don't disappoint me as well. Be honorable to the end.
			Spike: I'll try not to disappoint you, kid. I suppose I owe you that much. But I'll leave that whole "honor" thing up to you.
	[Keyword: Go home]
		Pierre: Yes... I can do that. I will return to <em>Ernie</em> and do my best to heal the damage I have done. I will protect my people from those who are like the fool I was.
			Spike: He's looking at me again!
			Blood: That's the best news I heard in a while.
			Fox: Say hi to that cute dad of yours for me!
			Barry: I have full heart from wholesomeness.
			Raven: Be good! Don't kill any more of your dad's friends!
			DrQ: Your path will be no less easy, but it will offer you riches you have not yet known existed.
