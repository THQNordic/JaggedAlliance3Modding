		TheBeast: You should be careful. These woods belong to the <em>Beast</em>. It munches cute little kids like you for breakfast.
			Larry: Ooooh, I know, I know! You are an old woman living in a small cottage in the forest, and you are surrounded by those creepy scarecrows, and... 
			TheBeast: And?
			Larry: Please, Missis Witch, do not turn me into a scarecrow!!!
			TheBeast: Only if you have been a naughty boy.
			Hitman: Most important meal of the day! ...What? Sorry, I zoned out for a second and all I heard was breakfast.
			Red: Well, if the wee beastie likes his meat tougher than week old haggis and twice as spicy, he's free to take a bite of this "cute kid" anytime!
			Kalyna: It sounds like an evil spirit that feeds on the young and innocent. I can't wait to meet it!
			TheBeast: Be careful what you wish for, my dear.
[Keyword: Tell us about the Beast]
	TheBeast: Most of the time it slumbers in its lair, but... But there are times when the moon's too bright, the chain's too tight, and the Beast won't go to sleep.
		Larry: Gulp...
	TheBeast: Then it goes out, this murderous Beast, and it roams these woods until it's satisfied with blood and carnage.
		Reaper: I couldn't have explained the dance of an Angel of Death any better myself.
		Omryn: Is werewolf? Is okay. I have silver bullets.
		Flay: This Beast and I, we are much alike. I look forward to hunting it.
		Kalyna: Hmmm... Sounds like a werewolf, but it could be a bugbear or maybe a vampire. Does it drink blood?
		TheBeast: Aren't you a curious little one? No, it does not.
		Kalyna: Okay, so vampire is out.
[Keyword: YOU are the Beast, aren’t you?]
		Barry: This Beast. I am thinking it is you.
		Buns: Unless I'm wrong, and I never am, YOU are the Beast.
		MD: Signs of blood under the nails. Powder burns on the knuckles. Excuse me, ma'am, but are YOU the Beast?
		Kalyna: Wait, I know! You're a shapeshifter! Will you teach me your magic?
		TheBeast: There is no magic, dear. There is only the thirst for justice, the lust for battle, and the willingness to do terrible things.
		Kalyna: But I already have those things and I'm no Beast.
	TheBeast: Aren't we all? Aren't you?... When you raise your gun at one of those bandits, and...
		Larry: What big eyes you have, Granny!
		TheBeast: Um, thank you. As I was saying...
	TheBeast: ...Then you catch them on the move, and you feel the recoil when the bullets rip them in half, and... And the feeling is joy.
		Blood: Gosh... This woman scares me.
		Reaper: This woman fascinates me.
		Flay: At this moment, I find you very attractive.
		Fidel: Yes! Ay, dios mío! This is what bring laughter to the heart of Fidel!
		Wolf: It's just a job - one I'm good at. Nothing more.
[Keyword: What’s the deal with the scarecrows?]
	TheBeast: They are here to keep the Beast asleep. They remind it of the good people it had known.
		Kalyna: I knew it! You are a good witch that repels evil with her magic!
		Larry: Oh, man... Let's split up and get out of here.
		Larry_Clean: Oh, kinda like my sobriety bear, only waaay creepier.
		Hitman: Hey, whatever it takes to get to sleep at night, right?
[Keyword: Is this how the “Beast” lives?]
	TheBeast: Yes. Most of the time, I'm just a harmless old woman. There are so many advantages to that. No one takes you seriously... until it's too late.
		Larry: I take you seriously! I don't want to be turned into a scarecrow!
		Shadow: The "sweet little old lady" disguise. One of my favorites.
		DrQ: Always seem less than you are and people will soon reveal their true nature to you.
		Kalyna: Woe to the careless traveller who takes the gifts of the forest without paying for them!
		TheBeast: Oh, my dear. You almost make me wish I had a daughter.
[Keyword: Are those cookies!?]
	TheBeast: Yes! Help yourselves. I hope you will find them... enchanting.
		Larry: Zoinks! Listen to me, people, DON'T EAT THE COOKIES!!! That's how she turned all these people into scarecrows!
		Kalyna: Magical cookies from a sweet old lady in a cabin in a Cursed Forest!? I can't wait to try!
		Omryn: There is enough for Omryn, but you will need more for others.
		Scope: I always tell my kids not to take sweets from strangers, but fresh-baked cookies are a different thing entirely!
	[Keyword: Thank you!]
		TheBeast: Come, have some more! Once people taste my cookies, they just don't ever seem to want to leave my cottage.
			Larry: I won't touch 'em with a ten-foot pole, man!
			Mouse: Yay! They're as tasty as it gets! May I have one more?
			TheBeast: Of course, sweet child. Take as many as you want, there are more where these came from.
			Scope: Mmm, darling, they are delicious! Would you care to share the recipe?
			TheBeast: But, of course! I'll write it down for you.
			Scope: Marvelous! And this here is my favorite cookie recipe. I would be delighted if you'd give it a try.
			Blood: Now this is what I call hot cuisine!
			TheBeast: I think you mean "haute cuisine" my dear, but thank you.
			Omryn: Okay, it is agreed. Omryn will stay here.
			TheBeast: I'm going to need more flour. A lot more.
			Kalyna: When do I turn into a gingerbread person?
			TheBeast: These are sugar cookies, dear, and you're already sweet enough as it is.
	[Keyword: No thanks]
		TheBeast: That almost breaks my heart. Well, I guess I will have to give them to the Beast.
			Larry: Let's leave this place before the Beast smells them!
			TheBeast: It may be a little too late for that, child.
			Larry: Oooohhh... Keep your eyes peeled, Ted!
[Keyword: Hands up!]
	TheBeast: Are you out of your mind? Put that gun down immediately! You will upset the Beast!
	[Keyword: Hands up, now!]
		TheBeast: I see you're a bunch of naughty kids like all the others. The Beast will have you.
	[Keyword: Mercs, open fire!]
		TheBeast: No, you won't kill the Beast so easily.
	[Keyword: Sorry, we were joking]
		TheBeast: Goodness! That was one very dangerous joke. The Beast doesn't like naughty kids scaring a frail old lady like that!
[Keyword: Will you support us against the Legion?]
	TheBeast: My answer remains "no". The people of my village still need their silent guardian, their watchful protector... their Beast.
[Keyword: Will you support us against the Legion?]
	TheBeast: Yes. Now that my people are safe... I was thinking - do you know the only remaining reward for being the Beast?
		Scope: Being able to bake top notch cookies in peace?
		Steroid: To see your enemies driven before you?
		Nails: A bitchin' outfit?
	TheBeast: ...You just get to be... the Beast! So, I will unleash my true self and show it to all of Grand Chien.
		Reaper: May you reap the souls of the wicked.
		Larry: Um... We better start sleeping in shifts, Ted.
		Len: And a grateful Grand Chien will thank you for your service.
		Smiley: I too wish to expose myself to all of Grand Chien!
