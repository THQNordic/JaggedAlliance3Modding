	Mollie: No! Smiley! What have you done? Look what you have done!

		Scope: Sorry, love. Never underestimate the stupid things a man will do for lust.

	Mollie: Wait, are you his friends? You look like mercenaries, same as <em>Smiley</em>. Are you also from <em>M.E.R.C.</em>? He told me they were the best mercenaries!
		Len: Some may have a different opinion on that.
		Meltdown: Ha! The best at getting the crap kicked out of 'em, maybe!
		Nails: They're a bunch of dweebs running around playing soldier.
		PierreMerc: They are incompetent fools.

	Mollie: And besides, I'm much better than those other girls. I am the Carnival Queen after all!
		Fox: Let's not get carried away, okay? Something about putting makeup on a pig?
		Mollie: Oh yeah? At least I know how to put on makeup! You've got more foundation than a construction site!
	Mollie: It's the celebration. Carnival? You know, the Throne of flowers, the crowds, the parties? I'm sure you must have heard of it.
		Hitman: I guess we've got a lot to learn from you. Are you giving private lessons?
		Mollie: That's all behind me. Er, I mean, that's in my past.
[Keyword: Booboo?...]
	Mollie: Yes! I mean <em>Boss Blaubert</em>, of course! But to me, he's my sweety-meaty Booboo-bear!
		Mouse: Eeew.
		Scope: That sounds lovely.
		Buns: Oh come on.
		Raven: Sweety-meaty?
	Mollie: He is very special to me, and I'm his one and only... But I wish he was more open with me. I guess a man like him has a lot of <em>secrets</em> to keep, even from the love of his life, right?
[Keyword: Boss Blaubert keeps secrets from you?]
	Mollie: I don't know. There are just times I ask him questions and he doesn't answer or pretends not to hear. I'm sure it is nothing.
		Shadow: Everyone is hiding something. Most aren't that great at it.

		Fox: Everyone has their naughty little secrets. I keep mine in a tight little box. No one is allowed in without permission.
		Livewire: Oh, but everyone has secrets! That is why I learned hacking and lock-picking. Otherwise, I would have no idea what is going on in this world!
		Magic: Every man out there got at least one secret he keeps from his old lady. Don't worry. Most times, it's just his collection of nudey mags.
	Mollie: ...But then again, he avoids my questions about that <em>globe</em> in the living room. It's password protected and he refuses to even let me try to guess it! Can you unlock it and see what's in there? Please? I'm dying to find out!
		Grunty: As my mother likes to say, "Don't go looking for secrets, you'll only find dead bodies." I look anyways, and just pretend I don't notice the bodies.
		Raven: It's probably incriminating evidence that he's a serial killer. Or maybe just porn. Hopefully not both.
