	Monday: Or maybe you're not <em>cadavérés</em>? I must be getting the hallucinations again. Got to stop drinking this merde and find some stronger merde to <em>drink</em>.
		Kalyna: A monster who talks and drinks? Hmmm... Do you have a name?
	Monday: ...
		Kalyna: Hello? Are you friendly?
	Monday: You still there? I guess this merde is merde, too.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Monday: Yeah! We have the merde, we have the people... You know what you get when you put together the merde AND the people?
		Nails: Good times!
		Igor: Hangover!
		Raider: Noise complaints.
		Scully: Regret.
		Scope: A lot of ruined linens.
		Tex: A good, old-fashioned ho-down, partner!

		Igor: We really deserve a medal this time.
		Kalyna: So, the curse is lifted?
		Monday: This isn't a curse. This is a blessing! I will stay drunk FOREVER!

		Igor: This is noble cause!

	Monday: You killed her? You killed her!!! Good riddance! She was trash, and not even good-looking trash these days. But you know what that means? That means you secured ALL THE MERDE! Yeah! All that moonshine! Time for a party!
		Larry: Oh yeah! Give me a syringe, I'll show you a trick or two.
		Igor: На здоровье!
		Larry_Clean: I'm actually not allowed to be within thirty feet of a party. Sorry.
		Kalyna: Does this mean the curse is lifted?
		Monday: You are ADORABLE! I tell you what - I will let you know after I finish drinking all of the witch's magic potions.
	Monday: Oh, wait. Nobody can actually come to the party, except for les cadavérés and they're no fun. I need people, REAL people to drink with!
		Igor: I'm here for you, my friend! Cheers!
		Larry: Don't worry about it, man. Imaginary people are WAY better than real people. Right, Ted?
		Kalyna: I guess we have to kill some more monsters before the curse is finally lifted. A hero's job is never done.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Monday: Still too many cadavérés shambling around... People are afraid to come to the party. What, do you want me to drink myself to death all alone? I want to drink myself to death in good company!
		Igor: Hey, are we not good enough for you?!
		Monday: You killed my ex, so you're my hero! But, I know you have other exes you need to go kill.
		Reaper: You will die as everyone dies. Alone.
		Monday: You are definitely NOT invited to the party.
		Sidney: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die, eh?
		Monday: Unless tomorrow is Monday!

[Keyword: You’re drunk]
	Monday: I know! I've been <em>drinking</em> since Monday. Not sure about the week. Just call me <em>Monday</em>. Have you met <em>my ex</em>?
		Scully: No thanks, mate. I'm full up on exes.
		Larry: You've been drinking since Monday and you've got X? Are... are you my spirit animal?
		Monday: Heeeeyyyy... You're going to do just fine here.
		Fox: You have an ex? Now, who would let a catch like you slip away?
		Monday: I know, right?!
[Keyword: Why are you drinking?]
	Monday: Because it's Monday! That Monday when <em>Bella</em> dumped me, I started drinking so hard that when I woke up, I didn't know the day of the week anymore. And the streets were full of them <em>cadavérés</em>, moaning and attacking everyone but me.
		Igor: Ah. It happens from time to time.
		Larry: I know exactly what you mean, man! It's terrible!
		Larry_Clean: I know this can't be right, but why do I have this feeling of Déjà vu?
	Monday: So I did what any man in my situation would do - I continued drinking and partying! I think that's why I didn't turn into one of them... At least not completely. I'll never stop drinking! Not this Monday! Not today!
		Igor: Toast to you, my friend! You deserve a medal.
		Kalyna: Poor sad lonely monster.
[Keyword: What are those cadavérés?]
	Monday: Cadavérés... They're like me. I mean, I'm like them. But not yet, not yet! Need more merde to drink. Cheers...
		Igor: Cheers! I can show you how to make potato vodka.
		Monday: Is it good merde?
		Igor: The best! You will see... unless it make you go blind.
		Kalyna: Oh, you're not a monster, but you're changing into one! Well, I guess that would make me drink, too.
[Keyword: Cadavérés are just sick people]
	Monday: Right, and today is just another manic Monday...
		Kalyna: I wish it was Sunday.
		Mouse: I wish it was Sunday.
	Monday: I know. You're sober and you need a reason to do the right thing. So let me tell you this: some of those people have already killed their own friends or relatives. Would YOU like to wake up from that nightmare and discover what you did?
		Igor: No. I drink to forget.
		Kalyna: No! I could never go on living with the thought that I have become a monster!... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
		Larry: I wouldn't know I did it.
		Larry_Clean: No. A hundred times no.
	Monday: After all, what reason do you need to die? Just send them to heaven and let them party with the angels.
[Keyword: We are not cadavérés]
		Kalyna: No! We are not monsters like them or... like you.
		Steroid: We are not dead peoples! Check out these biceps! Would a dead guy have this much definition?
		Thor: We are not dead. We are alive and full of potential!
	Monday: You're not? You sure? They must still be locked in their <em>houses</em> then. Some may be non <em>cadavérés</em>. But what is important... What's <em>important</em>... What was I talking about?
	[Keyword: About houses]
		Monday: Yes! Um, I grew up in one of those! I can't remember which one anymore, and I'm all alone anyway, so it's not important... 
	[Keyword: About what’s important]
		Monday: Yeah, well, I know what's important! What's important is that... Uh... It had to do with the thing before the important thing... 
	[Keyword: About rocket science]
		Monday: Right! It's not that hard to grasp, once you understand Kepler's laws. After all, the square of a satellite's orbital period is always proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet, right?
			Vicki: Don't look at me, mon. I work on cars, not rocket ships.
			Buns: That is... correct. I suppose I should be surprised, but I never let anything surprise me.
			Ice: ...You're distant from the planet.
		Monday: Wait... Um... That wasn't what I was talking about...

[Keyword: Tell us about cadavérés]
	Monday: Oh, yes. Cadavérés. They are not good company, with one notable exception - myself! But, eh, the others, I mean the people who are NOT les cadavérés - they are all locked in their houses, waiting for those who ARE les cadavérés to get tired.
		Igor: And do you? That is, um, do you not get hangover?
		Monday: Not at all! I may look like merde and you would think I would have to stop at some point...
		Kalyna: And do you ever get tired, or are you some sort of restless, drunken spirit?
		Monday: You know, I should be exhausted, but I feel GREAT! Drunk, but great. Still, I should maybe try to take a nap...
	Monday: But that isn't going to happen. Cadavérés don't get tired! Look at me, drinking day and night. I need drinking companions! So go on and shoot them. I mean, les cadavérés, not the other people.
		Igor: You are my role model. You and Uncle Ivan, of course!
		Kalyna: Don't worry, mister monster. We will save everyone and you will never feel lonely again!
[Keyword: Give us a blood sample]
	Monday: No problem! Give me a bucket, I have a knife. But be careful not to drink it all at once. There is more alcohol than blood in my blood.
		MD: That's... We're not... What?!
		Blood: I wasn't even thinking of doing that... but now you got me curious.
		Larry_Clean: I really wish you hadn't told me that.
[Keyword: Give us a blood sample]
	Monday: In my case, that's an alcohol sample. Wait... I'm not giving you my alcohol. I drank it, it's mine now. Kill Bella! Save the merde! Then you can have all the blood you want from me. 
[Keyword: Your ex?]
	Monday: It's all her fault! She brought it to us. <em>Bella</em>, you cold-hearted bitch, I'm drinking to your health. Non, not health. She's a cadavéré. She did this to me. To all of us!
		Igor: To Bella! Or not to Bella! Cheers!
		Larry: To all of us!
		Kalyna: It's a lover's curse! Oh, that's very bad.
[Keyword: Tell us about Bella]
	Monday: When she returned from that "business trip", she knew she had the disease. Then she dumped me and made a huge party in her house on the hill, with lots of dancing, and sex, and merde... moonshine. 
		Fox: That sounds bad. The more I think of it... Mmm, definitely a bad girl.
		MD: That is absolutely irresponsible. If I was her, I would never do that. I mean, um, I'm not talking about the part where she dumped you. Wait, don't get me wrong, I... Oof, I'll just shut up.
		Raven: When do we kill that bitch?
	Monday: She spread that merde over the whole town! And I just tried to drink myself to death. But that's not the point! The point is...
	Monday: What's the point? Ah! She has the merde! All of the moonshine. Go there, kill her, save the merde. I need it. It is a matter of life and... (hic) merde.
		Igor: Don't worry, we will save all the moonshine and kill the woman!
		Kalyna: So we bring the happy ending by... killing the princess and helping the prince become drunk? What kind of story is that?!
		Monday: It is a merde story. Welcome to Grand Chien, miss.
		Red: Kill a psychotic little hussy. Pick up whiskey. Dunnae worry, lad. I'm an expert in this particular type of to-do list.
