	LegionRaider_Jose: Oh la la! Don't shoot! I'm just a bystander here. An innocent civilian! I heard some shots fired up the hill. I came to take a look and I saw the <em>Legion</em> getting their asses kicked.
		Raven: Exactly what an innocent civilian would do.
		Omryn: Makes sense to me. Better to watch a fight than be in one.
		Livewire: I want you to know that I completely believe you, but I really don't think anyone else does.
	LegionRaider_Jose: But I'm not with them! I was just... umm... doing a bit of scavenging on the beach. Yeah, that's how I provide for my <em>family</em>!
	[Keyword: Don't worry]
			Raven: Take it easy, mister. We don't shoot civilians... generally.
			Buns: That's all right, dear. We don't shoot civilians... generally.
			MD: Oh, we don't shoot civilians! I mean, sometimes we do. I do. By accident, though. Not on purpose.
		LegionRaider_Jose: Oh, thank you! Maybe you just let me go on my way now, eh?
	[Keyword: Civilian? Oh really?]
			Meltdown: Yeah, and I'm the fucking tooth fairy.
			Raider: A well armed civilian, I see.
			Grizzly: That gun just for shooting squirrels then?
		LegionRaider_Jose: Oh, you mean this gun here? It's just, eh, heh-heh... iiiit's just for protection, boss. These are dangerous times on the island.
	[Keyword: Why not just shoot you]
			Fidel: One thing Fidel always say: no such thing as innocent bystander. When shooting start, you run and hide or stay and shoot.
			Meltdown: Don't bullshit me, boy. I shot the kneecaps off the last dumbass who tried that.
			Nails: Innocent bystanders are just people who haven't gotten a chance to shoot at me yet.
		LegionRaider_Jose: Please, boss, I... I don't want any trouble! I have a <em>family</em>. You won't snuff out a family man, right?
			Fidel: This is good point. I like it better when family is here to watch.
			Meltdown: Depends on how cranky I am. And just so you know, I ain't pooped yet today.
			Nails: Hell, everybody's got a family. That don't bother me one bit.
[Keyword: Tell us about that "Legion"]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Well, that's the Patriotic Legion of Grand Chien! Quite a gang, they are. I think some of them were trying to snatch that <em>Emma</em> girl, the President's daughter, but I guess it didn't work out.
[Keyword: What do you know about Emma?]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Don't know nothing, boss! I've just heard that the <em>Major</em> wants the girl. I guess he wishes to complete the set with her <em>father</em>, he-he.
		Ice: That dude got kidnapped and that's his daughter you're talkin' about. Put some respect in your mouth.
		Raven: I can tell how upset you are about it.
		Barry: What is wrong with you? Where is your compassion?
		LegionRaider_Jose: Oh, sorry, boss. I guess I dropped it.
[Keyword: Who's the Major?]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Oh, well, he's the leader of the <em>Legion</em>, of course! No one really seems to know him at all. They say he operates from a secret base up there in the <em>Highlands</em>...
		Tex: Sounds like he got a real hole-in-the-wall gang. How we get there? 
		Red: Speakin' as a Highlander, can ye be more specific? Highlands can be damn tricky terrain.
		Mouse: I love secrets! Can you tell me? I'm a mime, so you know I won't tell anyone.
	LegionRaider_Jose: Well I don't know for sure. It wouldn't be much of a secret if I knew it, right?
[Keyword: Who's the Major?]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Oh, well, he's the leader of the <em>Legion</em>, of course! No one really seems to know him at all. Very mysterious figure. Very dangerous. May I go now? Please?
[Keyword: Emma's father - you mean the President?]
	LegionRaider_Jose: You know, you're right. I think I heard something about that. But I don't know anything! I don't want to be involved in any of this, you know. Can I just go back to my <em>family</em>?
		Raider: You seem to know a lot for someone who's not involved, don't you?
		LegionRaider_Jose: Don't know what you're talking about, boss.
		Meltdown: Jeez, you're shadier than my ass crack.
		Grizzly: Something stinks here, and I'm not talking about my armpits.
[Keyword: So you have a family?]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Oh yes, boss. A big family over in <em>the Rust</em>! That's what we call the area just east of town. It's not a nice place. My boys cannot play <em>football</em> without tripping on old war equipment, hehe.
		Igor: Family is best important. Dolviches understand.
		Wolf: Old war equipment? Could be worth checking out.
	LegionRaider_Jose: They depend on me, you see. If I don't bring home the bacon, they don't eat! My poor family.

[Keyword: You're with the Legion!]
	LegionRaider_Jose: No, no, no! This is not true! Don't shoot me, boss! I mean... Maybe I had some dealings with the Legion in the past, but who doesn't? It is a small island.
		Buns: Yet I am rather convinced you are part of the Legion "family".
		DrQ: It is difficult to hide one's true self on such a small island.
		Thor: My friend, you are hiding mostly from yourself. Let the truth set you free.
	LegionRaider_Jose: Look, just let me go to my family and I... I will give you <em>diamonds</em> from my secret stash, I swear!
[Keyword: Hands up!]
		Fidel: It has been too long since the last time I killed someone! I'm getting itchy.

[Keyword: Hand over the diamonds]
	LegionRaider_Jose: Bien sur! Please, take these. I just found them on the beach, I swear... All yours now. I... I can go? And... You won't shoot me in the back?
		Fidel: No. Fidel like to aim for belly. More screaming that way.
		Omryn: I only shoot people for money... and for food.
		Steroid: Just drop your lunch money and run, little man!

		Mouse: Is it just me, or did that sound like a threat?!
		Wolf: Could have phrased that a little better.
		Fox: If I had a dime for every man who promised me that, I could buy my own island.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
