	Martha: Well, you sure know how to handle those Legion thugs. Wish I could say the same for my <em>husband</em>... They waved their guns at him and he just tucked his chin and followed.
		Steroid: Everyone's a hero in their own way. Just not everyone has my MIGHTY BICEPS! Just look at them!
		Mouse: You make it sound like that's a bad thing.
		MD: That's what I did the first time someone waved a gun at me... And the second time. And the third...
		Wolf: Some guys don't like fighting. Never understood that, myself.
	Martha: If he isn't kidnapped, he's going to wish he were dead when I lay my hands on him.

	Martha: Welcome to Martha and Herman's... Or probably just Martha's.
Now if you would excuse me, I've got work to do.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Martha: Still no trace of my dummy <em>husband</em>? I'm starting to worry.
[Keyword: Your husband?]
	Martha: Those <em>Legion</em> bastards came here and drank everything, and then they pushed my Herman outside and said they want to pay him for his services...
		Steroid: If I was here, they'd never take your husband alive!
		Igor: They drank... everything?
		Grizzly: I'm guessing that didn't mean they wanted to lay some cash on him.
		Omryn: Did they eat everything, too? Just curious.
	Martha: I am worried about him, but I have my doubts about this whole affair, I tell you!
[Keyword: We'll look for your husband]
	Martha: Thank you! It's good to know there are still decent people in this world. Please bring my Herman back to me.
		Omryn: Do not worry. Omryn is best tracker. I have snack and then go.
		Wolf: If your man's out there, we'll track him down.
		MD: We'll make sure he gets home safely.
	Martha: And if he happens to be fooling around with that little hussy - <em>Deedee</em> from the <em>Emerald Coast</em>, be sure to tell me!
		Raider: With all due respect, ma'am, we're not marriage counselors.
		Raven: But if we were, we would take a "lead by example" approach: The couple that shoots together, stays together.
		Raider: With all due respect, ma'am, we're not marriage counselors.
[Keyword: We'll save your husband!]

		Kalyna: Fear not! We will vanquish the evil-doers and return your beloved!
		Igor: It is good. We will retrieve wayward husband.
	Martha: You're just saying that to comfort me. But in fact, he may be dead, or worse!
		Red: What the hell could be worse, woman?!
		Steroid: I'll bring him dead or alive.
		Martha: Alive is better.
		Kalyna: Oh, worse than death is very bad.
	Martha: He may be fooling around with that little hussy <em>Deedee</em> from the <em>Emerald Coast</em>. If that is the case, I'll kill him myself!

		Fox: Oh, I see... You think he's stepping out on you, right?
		Livewire: You think he's with another woman? It's hard to see how that's worse than death. I think if you calm down and...
		Martha: Calm down?! DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!!!
	Martha: ...If he's with her, I swear I'll kill him myself!
[Keyword: We saved your husband!]
	Martha: Then where is he?! Don't tell me that he is with that harlot <em>Deedee</em>!... I'll kill him myself!!!
[Keyword: Nothing to worry about]

	Martha: IS THAT SO?! We'll see about that! Thanks for letting me know - oh, he'll have to explain EVERYTHING once he gets home!

		Fidel: Fidel's kind of girl.
		Raven: So she's an accomplice.
		Meltdown: You just take the middle part of that and you could be talking about any one of my nieces.

		Mouse: Well, that sounds a little far fetched.
		Vicki: I be strongly doubting it.
		Kalyna: An evil sorceress who kidnaps young men! I have heard of such things.
[Keyword: Emerald Coast?]
	Martha: It's a nice stretch of beach and sand dunes. Herman and I were planning to build a cottage up there, but we found out the place is littered with land mines.
		Fidel: A few mines never hurt anybody! I mean, mostly anybody.
		Livewire: This is so true! Good real estate is very hard to find.
		Omryn: Minefields always make me so tired.
		Barry: I do not like minelayers. They never pick up after themselves.

[Keyword: This is none of our business]
	Martha: But... he could be hurt, or... worse! He may be seduced by some other woman! Isn't there anything you can do?

		Martha: He better not be cheating on me!!! But if he is, I'll kill him personally!
[Keyword: He's probably dead...]
		Buns: You should consider the possibility that instead of flirting with some girl, he may be dead.
		Meltdown: Hate to break it to you, but by now he's probably takin' a dirt nap.
		Nails: This Herman guy is probably dead, but we could find his body if you want.
	Martha: What a cruel thing to say! I don't know why I thought you'd be different from those Legion thugs, but I want nothing to do with you from now on.
		Red: Calm down, woman, we'll see what we can do.
		Martha: Calm down?! DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!!!
