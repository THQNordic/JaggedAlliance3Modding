	Luigi: Take this as something to remember me by. And if your luck ever abandons you, come back to the family and we'll see what we can do.
	Luigi: Now please excuse me. Mister Blaubert needs a proper funeral as the great Boss he was.

	Luigi: What is this, ragazzi? You have killed my beloved Boss, eh? What do I do now with you?!
		Raven: Come on, you were about to kill him yourself.
	Luigi: It was MY JOB to kill Boss Blaubert. He grew soft-hearted, he neglected our business, he put shame on the face of the family. I was his right hand man, I should have killed him, not you.
		Raven: You both should have rotten in prison.
	Luigi: Here, take this money and leave. I don't want to see you again.
