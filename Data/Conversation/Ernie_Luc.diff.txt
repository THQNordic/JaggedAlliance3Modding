		Luc: He commands the <em>Legion</em> forces here on the island, but he's not really one of them. I mean, he is not like them. He's a good boy. Please, if you are here to fight the Legion, please try to spare my boy.

		[Keyword: Pierre is a criminal!]
				Fidel: Fidel no like this Pierre. You feel better after I kill him, don't worry.

		[Keyword: Goodbye]

[Keyword: What's the story with Pierre?]
	Luc: He... he doesn't understand the <em>choices</em> I've had to make. He doesn't respect me, so he won't listen. But he might listen to you. He's just <em>misguided</em>. Make him see that what he is doing can only end in his death.
		DrQ: Wisdom only comes to the willing, never to the willful.
[Keyword: What choices?]
	Luc: After my wife was killed by a band of river pirates, I convinced a group of friends to move with me and my son to <em>Ernie Island</em>, away from all the fighting. But <em>Pierre</em>... Well, he doesn't understand why I did not seek vengeance. So, he ran away and joined the Legion.
[Keyword: Pierre is just "misguided"?]
	Luc: Pierre always had a sense of honor. But the Legion corrupted him, made him do bad things in the name of discipline and strength. Now, he can't tell the difference between justice and cruelty.
[Keyword: Tell us about Ernie Island]
	Luc: Pierre hates this place, but he also wants to protect it. When my friends and I came here, we dreamed of building a safe haven. In his own way, so does Pierre.
[Keyword: What happened to Tinhay?]
	Luc: He was my oldest and dearest friend. He used to take care of my son when he was little, but when <em>Pierre</em> came back with his new Legion friends, they slaughtered old <em>Tinhay</em> like a dog in the street. 
And Pierre just watched and did nothing to stop them.
		Fidel: Fidel also enjoys watching such things.
[Keyword: Have you seen some other mercenaries?]
	Luc: Oh, those people. One of them - what was his name? Beef? Bev? ...can't remember. Anyway, he was planning to dock at the abandoned resort, <em>CÃ´te d'Azur</em>. I warned him to avoid it...
	Luc: The underwater rocks there are treacherous - that's why they canceled construction. He laughed at me - said his <em>fancy new boat</em> with the modern fiberglass hull could handle it.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	Luc: Farewell.
