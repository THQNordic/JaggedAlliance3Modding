[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Welcome to my little corner of Fleatown! My name is Lalee. You here to buy or sell? Don't tell me, let me guess... You're here about <em>diamonds</em>, right? I got a <em>good nose</em> for diamond traders - they smell like dirt, sweat, and blood. Or maybe that's just your clothes. Errr, no offense, of course.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Have you found the necklace of Madam Lecoq? Please, tell me you got it!
	[Keyword: We have the necklace]
		Broker: Let me see it! Oh, looking good! I can't wait to see how much I can squeeze out of those diamond-hungry <em>Adonis</em> fools for it! But I am getting ahead of myself. How do you feel about letting it go for <em>three grand</em>?
		[Keyword: Okay, here it is]
			Broker: That's the way to strike a deal! Boom, and it's done! Here, take the money plus a little present in appreciation for not wasting my time. Hope you like it!
				Red: May have left a wee bit of money on the table, but the vest will come in handy.
				Fox: I do like presents, especially ones I can put on... and then take off.
				Gus: I'll take a Kevlar vest over a dang necklace any day!
				Nails: A Kevlar vest, huh? It's cute, but not my type.
		[Keyword: Fifty grand!]
			Broker: Fifty!? You see the Hope Diamond on this thing or something? No. Best I can do is ten grand.
				Tex: Then we go sell somewhere else!
				Raven: I'll tell you what I DO see - a robbery in progress!
				Scope: We had to ruin a good deal of fine upholstery to find this thing, you know.
				Blood: A lot of blood was spilled over this necklace... or at least, there could be.
			Broker: But, wait. No. For you, I can do better. Probably wasn't easy finding it, right? You deserve a little extra for that! <em>Twelve grand</em>.
				Tex: Good thing I know how to haggle!
		[Keyword: Make it twenty]
				Buns: We have already paid you a diamond for the information that has lead us to finding this necklace. We are not, however, bound by contract to sell it to you.
				Raider: That necklace looks valuable. Maybe we should consider finding its rightful owner.
				Sidney: Allow me to clarify. You were good enough to sell us the information regarding this object. However, since a price for the object was not stipulated at the time, we are not bound to solely consider your offer...
			Broker: You certainly know how to haggle. Shall we agree to <em>fifteen grand</em>? It's refreshing to meet someone who can really play this game. Haggling is better than chess, change my mind!
		[Keyword: Adonis?!]
			Broker: Since they lost control of their mines, they've been gobbling up all the diamonds that appear on the black market. The fools are paying top dollar! Diamonds make people crazy.
				Raven: I hadn't noticed.
				Blood: Typical colonizer move.
				Fauda: They seek to accomplish their objective through other means. Makes sense.
	[Keyword: Still searching for it]
		Broker: You come to me first if you find it, okay? You won't find a better deal anywhere else, and besides, don't forget that I was the one who tipped you off, eh?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: My friends! I heard that <em>Boss Blaubert</em> wants to meet you. You won't forget your old friend Lalee now that you're swimming with the big fish, eh?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Found a chair but no necklace, eh? Don't get discouraged!
		Fauda: We have more important things to do than playing your game of chairs.
		Thor: Oh, I never get discouraged. That's what my breathing exercises are for.
		Meltdown: I ain't discouraged. You'll know when I get discouraged. Stuff usually blows up.
	Broker: I'm telling you, the necklace is inside the lining of one of those chairs! Keep looking! Find the <em>diamond necklace</em>, bring it to me and I'll give you a good price for it.
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Well hello, my friends! You need <em>information</em>, or you just love to see my face?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Well hello, my friends! I just came up with a great new concept. I call it <em>subscription</em>. You give me a diamond a month, and in return I will mail you a loot box! Great idea, isn't it?
		Red: That's a crock o'shit, lad. I willnae be buyin' somethin' I dinnae need, ye ken?
		Meltdown: Last guy who tried to sell me a subscription got a magazine jammed up his ass.
		Igor: I am already subscribed to vodka-of-the-month club.
	Broker: Are you here to buy <em>loot boxes</em>, or you need <em>information</em>?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Well hello, my friends! Tell me what you think of this: the <em>season pass</em>! You give me a lot of diamonds up front, and I will give you a lot of loot boxes at some point in the future! Sounds exciting, eh?
		Buns: So we don't even get a cat in a sack for our money, but only the promise of a potential cat in a sack?!
		Broker: Exactly! This is the future of commerce!
		Igor: What about opposite: You give me vodka. I drink all of it. Next day, you come for payment while I have hangover. I guarantee you get biggest deal of your life.
		Grunty: Ach! So complicated! I would rather go back to the barter system.
		Grizzly: Only season pass I have is for football - the MANLY kind of football, not this sissy-footsy ball you got over here.
	Broker: Are you here to buy <em>loot boxes</em>, or you need <em>information</em>?
[Keyword: Greeting]
	Broker: Well hello, my friends! You know, diamonds are great, but with so many people trying to control mining, cutting, selling... bleh! It's confusing! I'm thinking I should introduce a new kind of currency - an electric currency - controlled by just me, trustworthy Lalee! I call it <em>shitcoins</em>! Working title. 
		Mouse: In that case, why don't you give me the diamonds and you keep your... er, whatever it is you called it.
		Livewire: Well, you will need some kind of a public ledger, as well as some way to encrypt and broadcast the transactions... Hmm, I'll give it some thought.
		Wolf: Yeah, you might want to workshop that title a bit.
	Broker: Are you here to buy <em>loot boxes</em>, or you need <em>information</em>?
[Keyword: What information?]
	Broker: Oh, I happen to know all sorts of things. If you would be kind enough to grant me a <em>tiny diamond</em>, trusty Lalee will tell you a secret. What do you say? Trade what's in my head for what's in your pockets?
		Vicki: A whole diamond for your pep talk? You be crazy, mon.
		Len: If it's good intel, it's a deal. If it's not, then we might have a problem.
		Shadow: I give you a diamond and you give me a story? Better be one hell of a story.
[Keyword: What information?]
	Broker: I know what's cooking! One <em>tiny diamond</em> for each recipe, my friends.
	[Keyword: How do we get rich?]
		Broker: Save your money and never get sick. Next question. I am joking with you, of course! It just so happens your friend Lalee has a little get-rich-quick scheme you might be interested in...
	[Keyword: Something about Smiley]
	[Keyword: Something about Smiley]
		Broker: I knew it! You are after the boy! You're not the only one. A group of smugglers went after his girl and he <em>killed</em> one of them. They were ready to cut him down on the spot!
			Ivan: Молодец!
			Grizzly: Kid's got balls.
			Wolf: Sticks up for his girl, huh? I like him already.
			Kalyna: Like a prince from a fairy tale!
		Broker: I don't blame the boy - the <em>Carnival Queen</em> from <em>Pantagruel</em> is quite a treat. He was about to get sliced into pieces, but Boss Blaubert himself intervened and told the smugglers to get out. You should have seen their faces!
			Nails: Me, I'm starting to like this Boss.
			Fox: I'm sure this "Boss" was eying the girl.
			Hitman: That worked? No wonder they call him the Boss.
			Magic: Smooth. Boss likes things chill on his turf.
		Broker: And now comes the spicy part: the chick is with <em>Boss Blaubert</em> now! If you want to find her - Mollie, I think is her name - then check Blaubert's place down in <em>Rimville</em>. Be careful, though. The Boss doesn't like trespassers!
			Fox: A-ha!
			Kalyna: A captured princess! But what of the prince... er, I mean, Smiley.
			Omryn: This story is long. Is there popcorn?
		Broker: As for the boy, my exquisite nose tells me my friend <em>Father Tooker</em> knows more about him than he lets on. Uh, don't tell him I said so, though.
	[Keyword: The secrets of this town]
		Broker: Geez, I could write a book on that topic, and it wouldn't be enough to cover it! Where should I start?
			Buns: When writing books, I start with an outline, followed by a glossary of terms, followed by a list of contributing sources. When those are complete, I...
			Broker: Never mind the book. It was just a joke, eh?
		Broker: Hmm, I think I know what you might be interested in. Come on, give me your map.
	[Keyword: What is the meaning of life?]
		Broker: Oh, that's an easy one! It's 42. Next question!
			Nails: Listen up, you little shit. How about you stop playing games with me, and I don't break your pretty nose. Deal?
			Fidel: How about Fidel break that many bones in your body?
			Meltdown: Are you trying my patience, dumbass? 
		Broker: Okay, okay, I was just joking! Here, have your diamond back, and another one as a way to say "I'm sorry". We're friends again, yeah?
			Nails: We've never been buds, and we'll never be.
			Meltdown: We're not "friends", it's just me not kicking you in the nuts.
			Fidel: You want that?! Friends of Fidel, they no live very long. 
	[Keyword: What is the meaning of life?]
		Broker: Oh, that's an easy one! It's 42. Next question!
			Vicki: That be a very dumb joke, mon. Give us our diamond back!
			Grizzly: Nerd jokes? Man, we didn't fork over a diamond for nerd jokes.
			Scope: That joke was old when I was young. You expect us to pay for that?
		Broker: Come on, you asked a question! It was a fair deal.
			Red: Pushing yer luck, ye ken?
			Livewire: Actually, looking at the question from a computer programming perspective, this answer is really quite correct.
			Mouse: Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
	[Keyword: Can you forge a passport?]
		Broker: Sure! No problem, my friends! Just tell me the name. Oh, it will cost you <em>one diamond</em>, please.
	[Keyword: Forge a passport for Karen Gosling]
		Broker: Here you go, even better than the real McCoy.
[Keyword: Read this Maquis Manifesto]
	Broker: Nice paper, very soft to the touch. Not many readers around here, but everybody poops, right? You got any more of these? Most people haven't had a good wipe in years. This is the new shit, everyone will love it!
		Barry: I have no love for communism, but I do not think manifesto was meant to be personal hygiene aid.
		Broker: Communists believe in propaganda. I believe in supply and demand!
		Grizzly: Fuck yeah! Another victory for capitalism!
		Igor: Well, at least the proletariat will have good hygiene. We will call it a win for comrade Lenin.
[Keyword: Are you buying diamonds?]
	Broker: Not buying. No, no. Trading! If you have diamonds, I have some very special items you may be interested in acquiring. You see, I have an innovative approach which one day will become the future of commerce! I'm trading only in <em>loot boxes</em>!
[Keyword: Loot boxes?!]
	Broker: Oh yes!... 
[Keyword: Loot boxes]
	Broker: Just one <em>tiny diamond</em> for a box, my friend! There could be anything inside. Definitely won't be nothing.
	[Keyword: Remind us about these “loot boxes”]
		Broker: A <em>loot box</em> is a box of mystery! Maybe you'll find a pile of treasure or maybe you'll find a pair of dirty underwear. Who knows? Fun, right? No money involved - just <em>one tiny diamond</em> buys you a box. Buy as many boxes as you like! 
			Ivan: Idiot game for idiots.
			Fauda: Just so we're clear - if you sell me a box of dirty underwear, I'll make you eat it.
			Larry: Is this gambling? Sounds like gambling. I'm in!
	[Keyword: Where do we get diamonds?]
		Broker: You should go to my good friend <em>Father Tooker</em> in La Boue! The holy man buys and sells diamonds to support his hobby of saving the souls of the needy - which is good, because those poor buggers are DAMN needy! 
			Barry: The Father has strange ideas, but he has good heart.
			Thor: I'm guessing you don't get much sensitivity training around here.
			Grunty: Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is collecting early twentieth century clown paraphernalia.
		Broker: And I'm proud to say that I'm contributing to his noble mission by helping him <em>resell</em> any gems he manages to find.
	[Keyword: What is your deal with Father Tooker?]
		Broker: Oh, I'm glad you asked! You see, he pays about 600 per gem. If he resells them to the <em>smugglers</em>, they'd give him merely 400 per gem. That's why he makes a deal with <em>my generous person</em> for 900. Are you following me?
			Vicki: Okay...
			Buns: I already have questions...
			Ice: With you so far...
		Broker: Then he pays 100 more to <em>Boss Blaubert</em> in exchange for protection against acts of God and whatnot, and keeps the remaining 200 for his church. Then I sell the gems to the <em>smugglers</em> for only 400 a piece, because they are my friends and everyone must make a profit!
			Vicki: What the...
			Buns: My questions have multiplied...
			Ice: Hold up, homes. You lost me.
		Broker: The <em>smugglers</em> sell to the <em>Boss</em> for 500 a piece, which he can pay because he's rich. He then resells all the gems to <em>Adonis</em> at 600 each, which they'll pay, because they prefer to deal with the boss instead of all the small fish.
			Vicki: What the hell, mon?!
			Buns: Did you just say Adonis?
			Ice: Yeah, okay. That last part I got.
		Broker: Finally, Adonis pays me 600 as a broker's fee, and everyone is happy, because everyone gets their share! Simple, right?
			Vicki: So, you be nothing more than a middle-man.
			Broker: I prefer to think of myself as a facilitator who oils the wheels of commerce!
			Buns: So, you're just using everyone to make money off of Adonis?
			Broker: Why not? They're the ones with the money.
			Ice: Ain't you afraid someone will find out you're cheating everyone?
			Broker: Who's cheating? Everyone sacrifices a little profit to make sure everyone makes a little profit.
	[Keyword: You mentioned Adonis?]
		Broker: They used to control the diamond mines until the Legion pushed them out. They must miss their <em>diamonds</em>, because lately they've been buying them off the black market in bulk! Nice people with deep pockets who let everyone get their share!
			Magic: Nice people with deep pockets are my very favorite kind of people.
			DrQ: Deep pockets often hide deep secrets.
			Omryn: They seem nice. Hey, do you sell snacks? You should sell snacks.
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Happily! Just one <em>tiny diamond</em> per loot box! Don't have any? Go buy some from Father Tooker!
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: There you go! Do you like it? This here is a powerful substance, my friends - it prolongs life, grants visions of the future, and makes your eyes blue! You might have to take a lot of it to make that last thing happen.
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Hmm, looks like a dead cat. Well, that's the mystery of the loot box for you! Could have just as easily been a live one, but it wasn't.
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Whoa! Damn, that cat scared the poop out of me! How did it even survive in there? Well, that's the mystery of the loot box. Could have just as easily been a dead cat, but it wasn't.
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: BANG! He-he, made you jump! I'm sure you'll have a blast with those.
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Well, I guess you'll get some use out of those. Me, I don't like guns. I prefer loot boxes! Care to try again?
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Well, that's... You know, I'm not sure how that even fit in there. Well, that's the mystery of the loot box for you!
			Igor: He-he, my favorite toy. I will call it "Legion Surprise"!
			Ivan: Наконец-то этот идиот продал нам что-то стоящее.
			Ice: Now that's what I call a good deal!
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Oh, a comic book collection! Good quality paper, too. Good for reading, that is, not for wiping. Too much ink.
			Larry: I love it, man!
			Larry_Clean: I love it, man!
			MD: Oh, hey! Neat!
			Kalyna: Now THIS is a treasure!
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Oh, that's... You know, I have no idea what that is. Behold, the mystery of the loot box! Care to try again?
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Hmm, this came as a shipment from <em>Ille Morat</em>. There is this weird mechanic lives down around there...
	[Keyword: Sell us a loot box]
		Broker: Oh, this seems to be our promotional package, my friends! You pay one diamond, and you get back two! 
[Keyword: Be careful about your nose]
		Red: Ya know what's bad about your good nose? Someone may break it for smelling too much.
		Nails: You want that nose of yours smashed?
		Broker: Non-non...
		Nails: Then don't play the smart guy.
		Hitman: That's funny. I don't like so much you being funny.
	Broker: No need to get worked up, my friends. I can't help myself. My nose is specially designed for smelling useful <em>information</em>.
		Red: Don't worry, lad, I can fix it.
		Broker: It would be a shame to damage such an exquisite tool!
[Keyword: Remind us about the twelve chairs]
	Broker: This is the story: some years ago <em>twelve special chairs</em> from the mansion of the late Madam Lecoq in Pantagruel were sold right here in this very market.
		Len: We don't deal in stolen goods.
		Broker: They weren't stolen! It was an estate sale. Now listen:
		Reaper: Special how? Were they constructed out of the bones of her ancestors?
		Broker: What?! No! Why would you even think that? Nevermind. I don't want to know. Just listen:
		Ice: He-he... Madam Lecock?
		Broker: It's pronounced "Lecoq." Now listen:
	Broker: Rumor has it that good old Madam Lecoq sewed her priceless <em>brilliant diamond necklace</em> into one of those chairs! In a journal an associate of mine just recovered, she admitted doing this because she feared Pantagruel commies would rob her. Sadly, she left no clue as to which chair she used!
		Vicki: Why you be telling us that, mon?
		Magic: Sounds to me like you need a personal shopper, not a merc.
		Wolf: Now comes the part where you tell us the chairs were bought by a bloodthirsty warlord.
	Broker: Look, I'd track them down myself, but I'm no treasure hunter. You, on the other hand, I bet you've got what it takes to get that necklace. Bring it to me and you'll get both a good price and the undying gratitude of me - trusty Lalee! 
		Fauda: But this necklace was property of the old woman. Does her family not search for it?
		Broker: Don't worry, she's got no living heirs.
		MD: You... You think I've got what it takes? I mean, of course! Of course, I do!
[Keyword: Where do we find those chairs?]
	Broker: I know for sure that two of the chairs were given as "good will" gifts to <em>Boss Blaubert</em>. You're lucky, because one of them is right here in his villa! The other one is probably in <em>Rimville</em>.
	Broker: Speaking for myself, I wouldn't touch something that belongs to the guy who practically owns Fleatown, but you... well, I'm betting the boss doesn't scare someone like you, he-he!
		Reaper: Fear is a commodity bought and sold at auction, where the loudest voice gets the most.
		Broker: I like that! I'm not sure what it means, but I like it!
		Buns: I haven't been scared since I was a little girl. Mommy forgot it was class picture day and dressed me in overalls. I don't like to talk about it.
		Broker: I'll make a note never to bring it up.
		Grizzly: I eat fear for breakfast and crap bullets in the afternoon.
		Broker: You may want to see a doctor about that.
[Keyword: Goodbye]
	Broker: Goodbye, my friends!
