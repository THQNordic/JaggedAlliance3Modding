		Raider: Team, prepare for a croc attack.
[Keyword: Are you some kind of Shaman?]

		Magic: Sister, you must be exhausted.
[Keyword: What happened to Wassergrab?]

		Raven: It doesn't sound like you're doing much to help them out.
		Raven: Says who, the person who is using them for unwitting labor?

		Hitman: I wonder if that counts as polygamy, or maybe just that you're a happy widow.
		Barry: This is most evil and wicked.

		Nails: You, uh, get a lot of guys come in here and explore your hole?
		Witch: Only those with the proper amount of stamina.
		Grizzly: Oh, I don't want to meddle, but I think I might like to watch.
[Keyword: Where is the man who entered your house?]
	Witch: I am a bridge between our world and the <em>Spirit World</em>. He walked through me last night, and I have guided his soul.

		Fox: Walking in the Spirit World? I don't think I've heard it called that before!
		Thor: That is beautiful. Two souls joining and moving... in and out... My aura feels flushed and tingling.
[Keyword: Tell us more about the “Spirit World”]
		Thor: Enlighten me about the Spirit World.

		Omryn: You will talk of Spirit World. I will have snack.
		Buns: If I promise not to laugh, will you tell me about the Spirit World?
		Raider: I'm guessing the Spirit World isn't a place I can find on a map, right?
		Sidney: I've travelled a great deal over the years, but I've never visited the Spirit World. I'm keen to learn more about it.

		Fox: At the bottom of a dark hole, huh? Kinky.
		Hitman: Where do I sign up for a ritual or two?
		Barry: You wicked witch! You are raping men in your pit of sin!
		Red: Och! I remember when I used to be able to search for the wisdom of the spirits all night long.
		MD: ALL night long? I mean, you take breaks and stuff... right?
		Smiley: This is a gift you are giving. I wish to show you my spirit. Should I just take it out now?
		Thor: I feel my soul swelling just thinking about it.
		Buns: You could try just teaching them how to practice self-love... That sounded different in my head.
[Keyword: You are forcing the men to dig for diamonds]
	Witch: I am not exactly forcing them. They come willingly, thinking they will enjoy a night of sexual satisfaction.
		Hitman: Who can blame them?
		Livewire: But you turn the tables and use them to get money! It's the honey pot! I love that scam.
		Nails: I bet they do!

		Witch: I am glad that you understand. Will you keep my secret? Let it become... our secret. If you will honor me as the beautiful and terrible witch, the mistress of this land, I will even share with you a thing or two.
			Hitman: Oh, I'll honor you! I'd honor you twice if you let me!
			Mouse: Ooh... It is quite hot in here, isn't it?
			Grizzly: What you want to share wouldn't happen to be at the bottom of a hole, would it?
		Witch: Indeed, I am willing to offer you <em>diamonds</em>... and more.
			Raider: Thanks, but we'll stick with the diamonds.
			Raven: Damn right you'll stick with the diamonds.
			Fox: Where have I heard THAT before...
			Kalyna: A witch's bargain?! How exciting! Hang on, I have a book that talks all about this kind of thing.
	[Keyword: We’ll keep your secret]
