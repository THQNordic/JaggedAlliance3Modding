At ease with firearms and explosives, he is wanted on a worldwide warrant for his role in the Cancun Catastrophe, but has managed to stay one step ahead of the organisations seeking his capture." - A.I.M. Dossier, Jagged Alliance\n\nJA2: \n\n"Due to numerous employee complaints concerning his refusal to follow orders, Fidel "Leave me alone, I\'m busy!" Dahan was recently suspended for a thirty-day period. Promising a changed attitude, he was returned to active duty by A.I.M. though because he is so proficient with both firearms and explosives." - A.I.M. Dossier, Jagged Alliance 2\n\nAdditional info:\n\nHas a comical ruthlessness to him. Conveyed by a short, heavy, Cuban accent.\nUsually mad about something, shows hints of a softer side but even that is tainted.\nExtremely impatient. Type of guy that would force a square into a circle while blaming the square for his frustration.\nJagged Alliance 2 has Fidel "Not being quite himself lately". There are some hints suggesting this has something to do with the disappearance of Hurl E. Cutter.\nTrivial bits of dialogue in various games suggest he may be homosexual.',
