He\'s one of our most distinguished mercenaries and perhaps the most respected among his peers. Scully holds the A.I.M. record for the highest number of combat engagements in almost as many different countries. Need someone to snap the last breath from an enemy? Then Sullivan\'s your man. Scully is well-known for his skills with a bladed weapon."\n\nAdditional info:\n\nScully is a super friendly guy. He\'s been married eight times and has twenty one kids.\nThough British, he has a out-going demeanor easily mistaken for Australian. His cockney accent, tanned complexion and propensity to call people "mate" doesn\'t help.\nDeadly, yet exhibits no fascination for gore.\nWe are told, over and over, that Scully is well known for his skill with blades.\nHe likely holds the record for combat engagements in Jagged Alliance 2 now due to the departure of his old friend Mike.',
